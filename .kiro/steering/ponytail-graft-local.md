## Repository-local agent tools

This repository pins Ponytail and Graft under
`.agent-tools/ponytail-graft/`. Run every Graft command as
`node .agent-tools/ponytail-graft/bin/graft.cjs ...`; any bare `graft ...`
example in generated Graft guidance is shorthand for that repository-local
launcher. Never substitute a global `graft` or an unpinned `npx` invocation.
Ponytail governs implementation economy; Graft supplies repository evidence,
especially for Ponytail ladder rung 2 (reuse what already exists).
